# Raytracer

Raytracer implementation in pure C99. This project also features a 24 bit bmp encoder and as well as a simple linear algebra library for doing vector math.

# TODO
- [ ] extend the linear algebra library to support matrix math
- [ ] extend the camera implementation to support arbitrary camera positioning
- [ ] explore ways to optimize this implementation while also maintaining a clean/readable code base
